#ksekina

A seed project inspired by & largely based on [Angular-Kickoff-Seed](https://github.com/marcelinhov2/angular-kickoff)

##Main differences
* Testing tools: Mocha+Chai+Sinon
* After building minified dist files, a hash is appended as revision (via gulp-rev)
* Includes bootstrap + angular-ui-router dependencies
* Recommends [Angular best-practice structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/mobilebasic?pli=1)

##How to use it
* First, install npm (via [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/))
* Then, install bower:
	npm install -g bower
* Following that, install gulp:
	npm install -g gulp
* Finally clone the repository and run the following commands in the top directory:
	npm install
	bower install
	gulp
* After running gulp, an auto-reloading server is waiting for you at localhost:8080.
